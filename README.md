# StartupSuccessPrediction
This code attempts to predict the outcome of a startup by putting it in one of 4 groups: operating, closed, acquired, IPO. 
It was done in a group of 4 using the data from the following kaggle notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/startup-investments
The code was accessing data saved on a shared one drive and so in order to make use of it small changes would be needed according to how the user saves the data and provides it.
It also includes a the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and several other tasks that were done.
The prediction was done using multiple methods which are availaible to view.
The report which is also in this repository mentions all the used and engineers featured along with other technical details.
